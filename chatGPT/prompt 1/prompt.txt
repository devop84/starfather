OK, so lets create a basic smart contract using gnosis safe module.
The variables used should be as followed : 
- the list of participants (including the campain's owner)
- the old name of the star
- the new name of the star
- the status of the votes (boolean)

If the vote is more than 51% than the star is renamed
Participants are identified with their wallet address

frontend should be in JS
